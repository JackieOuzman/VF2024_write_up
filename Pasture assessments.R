### LP pasture assessments 
# I have only created a biomass map for post trial, we dont have biomass cut for the pre trial.
# I have converted Damian biomass cuts to kg/ha with the assumption of the size (I need to check).
# The correlation and R2 are poor and this could relate to the lack of vegeation, other signals are no better.
# we should consider if this data is good enough to present.
# the VF 1 shows as having lowest biomass.
# buffer dosent have higher biomass than grazed parts of the paddock.
# we canâ€™t assume different parts of the paddock at a fixed time is due to grazing.
